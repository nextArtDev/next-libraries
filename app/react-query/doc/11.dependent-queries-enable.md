# Dependent Queries

Fetching data that depends on the result of another request
What if the API doesn't give us everything we'd want to display up front - it __just returns the id of the director__, which we then have to use to fetch the director's information.

One way to think about dependent queries is to not think about them as different queries at all. It should be clear by now that the queryFn doesn't need to be coupled to a single fetch.

```ts
function useMovieWithDirectorDetails(title) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['movie', title],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const movie = await fetchMovie(title)
      const director = await fetchDirector(movie.director)

      return { movie, director }
    },
  })
}

function Movie({ title }) {
  const { data, status } = useMovieWithDirectorDetails(title)
  //...
```

But comes some downsides:

- They will always fetch and refetch together
- They will error together
- There's no de-duplication for either request. (This is probably the biggest drawback. Because both requests are under the same queryKey, you have no way of knowing if certain data has already been fetched and cached elsewhere.)

## enabled prop

The query for useDirector is disabled when id is undefined. That's the key to making this work. We only want to fetch the director when we have an id to fetch it with.
We can still even have a useMovieWithDirectorDetails hook that abstracts away the logic of combining the two queries.
Now, unlike before, __we'll get separate cache entries for each movie__, and a single entry for the director. This gives us total control over how we define and use each resources.

```ts
import * as React from "react"
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { fetchMovie, fetchDirector } from './api'

function useMovie(title) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['movie', title],
    queryFn: async () => fetchMovie(title),
  })
}

function useDirector(id) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['director', id],
    queryFn: async () => fetchDirector(id),
    enabled: id !== undefined
  })
}

function useMovieWithDirectorDetails(title) {
  const movie = useMovie(title)
  const directorId = movie.data?.director
  const director = useDirector(directorId)

  return {
    movie,
    director
  }
}

function Movie({ title }) {
  const { movie, director } = useMovieWithDirectorDetails(title)

  if (movie.status === 'pending') {
    return <div>...</div>
  }

  if (movie.status === 'error') {
    return <div>Error fetching {title}</div>
  }

  return (
    <p>
      Title: {movie.data.title} ({movie.data.year})
      <br />
      { director?.data
        ? <> Director: {director.data.name}</>
        : null
      }
    </p>
  )
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Movie title="The Godfather" />
      <Movie title="The Godfather Part II" />
    </>
  )
}

```
