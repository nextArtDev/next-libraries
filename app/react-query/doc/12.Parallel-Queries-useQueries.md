# Parallel Queries

Any serious application will likely have multiple queries happening in parallel, and an obvious principle of web development is that: The more you can do in parallel, the better.

you could combine the multiple fetch requests into a single query with the help of Promise.all.

```ts
function useReposAndMembers() {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['reposAndMembers'],
    queryFn: () => {
      return Promise.all([fetchRepos(), fetchMembers()])
    }
  })
}
```

This approach has some downsides.

1. repos and members will always fetch and refetch together
2. repos and members will always error together
3. We can't re-use repos or members separately in other parts of our app.

or another solution:

## useQueries

You pass it an array of queries, and similar to Promise.all, it will run them in parallel and return an array of results where the order of the elements is the same as the order of the queries.

```typescript
function useReposAndMembers() {
  return useQueries({
    queries: [
      {
        queryKey: ['repos'],
        queryFn: fetchRepos,
      }, 
      {
        queryKey: ['members'],
        queryFn: fetchMembers,
      }
    ]
  })
}

...

const [repos, members] = useReposAndMembers()
```

 if you wanted to show a loading indicator while any of the queries were still fetching, you could derive that value like this.

```ts
const queries = useReposAndMembers()

const areAnyPending = queries.some(
  query => query.status === 'pending'
)
```

Or if you only wanted to show a loading indicator while all of the queries were still fetching, you could derive that one like this.

```ts
const queries = useReposAndMembers()

const isAnyPending = queries.every(
  query => query.status === 'pending'
)
```

## The array of queries you pass to useQueries can be dynamic

- Get the repos with a useRepos hook

```ts
function useRepos() {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['repos'],
    queryFn: fetchRepos
  })
}
```

- Get the issues of every repo with a useIssues hook
First, we're going to want to have useIssues accept an array of repos as its only argument.

Next, we can invoke useQueries, mapping over repos to create our queries array.

For the queryKey, let's use a key that represents the entry in the cache â€“ repos/${repo.name}/issues.

For the queryFn, we'll want to fetch all of the issues for the repo we're currently iterating over and return them to be put in the cache.

The last thing we'll want to do is make sure that if repos is undefined (which it will be while the query is pending), that our queries property is still an empty array.

There are a few ways we could do this, the simplest being with JavaScript's nullish coalescing operator.

```ts
function useIssues(repos) {
  return useQueries({
    queries: repos?.map((repo) => ({
      queryKey: ['repos', repo.name, 'issues'],
      queryFn: async () => {
        const issues = await fetchIssues(repo.name)
        return { repo: repo.name, issues }
      }
    })) ?? []
  })
}
```

## The Whole Example 

```ts
import { useQuery, useQueries } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { fetchRepos, fetchIssues } from './api'

function useRepos() {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['repos'],
    queryFn: fetchRepos
  })
}

function useIssues(repos) {
  return useQueries({
    queries: repos?.map((repo) => ({
      queryKey: ['repos', repo.name, 'issues'],
      queryFn: async () => {
        const issues = await fetchIssues(repo.name)
        return { repo: repo.name, issues }
      }
    })) ?? []
  })
}

export default function App() {
  const repos = useRepos()
  const issues = useIssues(repos.data)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>TanStack Dashboard</h1>
      <h2>Repos</h2>
      {repos.isPending ? <p>Loading repos...</p> : null}
      {repos.isError 
        ? <p>Error loading repos: {repos.error.message}</p>
        : null}
      {repos.isSuccess 
        ? <ul>
            {repos.data.map((repo) => {
              const repoIssues = issues.find(
                query => query.data?.repo === repo.name
              )

              const length = repoIssues?.data.issues.length
              
              return (
                <li key={repo.id}>
                  {repo.name}
                  {repoIssues
                    ? ` (${length === 30 ? "30+" : length} issues)`
                    : null
                  }
                </li>
              )
            })}
          </ul>
        : null}
    </div>
  )
}
```
