# Managing Mutations

## But what about asynchronous state updates?

For sth which wew want to happen imperatively when a specific event occurs, React Query offers another hook called useMutation.

Just as useQuery manages the lifecycle of a request rather than directly fetching data, useMutation manages the lifecycle of a mutation rather than directly performing the mutation itself.

When you invoke useMutation, you give it an object with a mutationFn method. __What it gives you is an object with a mutate method__.

When you invoke mutate, React Query will take the argument you pass to it, and invoke the mutationFn with it.

- First, we encapsulate useMutation inside of a custom hook â€“ passing it updateUser as its mutationFn.
- Then, inside of the component, we invoke mutate whenever the mutation event occurs.
_The object we pass to it will be passed along to the mutationFn as an argument._

```ts
declare function updateUser(user: { id: string; newName: string }): Promise<User>

function useUpdateUser() {
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: updateUser,
  })
}

type Payload = { id: string; newName: string }

function useUpdateUser() {
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: (payload: Payload) =>
      updateUser(payload)
  })
}

function ChangeName({ id }) {
  const { mutate } = useUpdateUser()

  return (
    <form
      onSubmit={(event) => {
        event.preventDefault()
        const newName = new FormData(event.currentTarget).get('name')
        mutate({ id, newName })
      }}
    >
      <input name="name" />
      <button type="submit">Update</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

The entire point of useMutation is to manage the lifecycle of the mutation â€“ not to mutate anything itself, even the cache.

We probably want to reset the form after the mutation was successful. We can do that by passing an object with an onSuccess callback as the second argument to mutate.

And inside of useMutation, if we wanted to show an alert when the mutation was successful, we could do something like this.

And whatever is returned from the mutationFn â€“ in this case, the return value of updateUser, will be passed as the first argument to onSuccess.

So assuming that updateUser returns a promise that resolves with the updated user, we could do something like this.

```ts
function useUpdateUser() {
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: updateUser,
    onSuccess: (newUser) => {
      alert(`name updated to ${newUser.name}`)
    }
  })
}

function ChangeName({ id }) {
  const { mutate, status } = useUpdateUser()

  return (
    <form
      onSubmit={(event) => {
        event.preventDefault()
        const newName = new FormData(event.currentTarget).get('name')
        mutate({ id, newName }, {
          onSuccess: () => event.currentTarget.reset()
        })
      }}
    >
      <input name="name" />
      <button type="submit" disabled={status === "pending"}>
        { status === "pending" ? '...' : "Update" }
      </button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

## How mutations and queries can work together

What if instead of just showing an alert, you wanted to actually do something useful and update the cache with the new user?

The simplest way is to do it __imperatively by invoking queryClient.setQueryData in the onSuccess callback__. setQueryData works as you'd expect, _you give it a query key as its first argument and the new data as the second_.

Now, once the mutation has finished and the onSuccess callback runs, the cache will be updated with the new user.

React Query doesn't distinguish where data comes from. Data we write to the cache manually will be treated the same as data put into the cache via any other way â€“ like a refetch or prefetch.

That means __it will also be considered fresh for however long staleTime is set to__.

```ts

import { queryOptions } from '@tanstack/react-query'

const userOptions = (id: number) => queryOptions({
  queryKey: ['user', id],
  queryFn: () => fetchUser(id)
})

function useUpdateUser() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient()

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: updateUser,
    onSuccess: (newUser) => {
        //'user' is query tag of query we want to update
    //NOT TS:   queryClient.setQueryData(['user', newUser.id], newUser)
    queryClient.setQueryData(
  userOptions(newUser.id).queryKey,
  newUser
)
    }
  })
}
```

And even if updateUser didn't return a promise that resolved with the updated user, we still have a few options to derive the new user in order to update the cache.

## queryClient.setQueryData

We can use this, along with the fact that if you pass a function as the second argument to _queryClient.setQueryData_, __it will receive the previous data as an argument__, in order to derive the new user to update the cache.

```ts
function useUpdateUser() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient()

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: updateUser,
    onSuccess: (data, { id, newName }) => {
      queryClient.setQueryData(
        ['user', id], 
        (previousUser: TData | undefined) => TData | undefined) => previousUser
          ? ({ ...previousUser, name: newName }) 
          : previousUser
      )
    }
  })
}
```

What this means is that __when you update the cache, you should always return a new object, even if the object you're updating is the same as the previous one__.

For example, you may be tempted to refactor the setQueryData invocation like this, where you just mutate the previousUser directly.

```ts
//not correct

queryClient.setQueryData(
  ['user', id], 
  (previousUser) => {
    // 
    if (previousUser) {
      previousUser.name = newName
    }

    return previousUser
  }
)

```

##  Handling more than one cache entry

This can happen pretty easily when we have a list with filters and sorting. Every time we change an input, React Query will create a new cache entry, which means __one result might be stored multiple times__, in different caches, and even in different positions (e.g. depending on the sorting criteria).

We're triggering the mutation when the form is submitted, but we haven't implemented updating the cache yet because it's not as simple as just calling queryClient.setQueryData with the updated list.

```ts
 
function useAddTodo() {
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: addTodo,
    onSuccess: (data) => {
      console.log(JSON.stringify(data))
    }
  })
}

function useTodos(sort) {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient()

  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['todos', 'list', { sort }],
    queryFn: () => fetchTodos(sort),
    placeholderData: () => queryClient.getQueryData(['todos', 'list', { sort }]),
    staleTime: 10 * 1000
  })
}

export default function TodoList() {
  const [sort, setSort] = React.useState('id')
  const { status, data, isPlaceholderData, refetch } = useTodos(sort)
  const addTodo = useAddTodo()

  const handleAddTodo = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    const title = new FormData(event.currentTarget).get('add')
    addTodo.mutate(title, {
      onSuccess: () => event.target.reset()
    })
  }

  if (status === 'pending') {
    return <div>...</div>
  }

  if (status === 'error') {
    return <div>Error fetching todos</div>
  }

  return (
    <div style={{ opacity: isPlaceholderData ? 0.8 : 1 }}>
      <label>
        Sort by:
        <select
          value={sort}
          onChange={(event) => {
            setSort(event.target.value)
        }}>
          <option value="id">id</option>
          <option value="title">title</option>
          <option value="done">completed</option>
        </select>
    </label>
      <ul>
        { data.map(todo => (
          <li key={todo.id}>
            {todo.done ? 'âœ… ' : 'ðŸ—’ '}
            {todo.title}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <form
        onSubmit={handleAddTodo}
        style={{ opacity: addTodo.isPending ? 0.8 : 1 }}
      >
        <label>Add:
          <input
            type="text"
            name="add"
            placeholder="new todo"
          />
        </label>
        <button
          type="submit"
          disabled={addTodo.isPending}
        >
          Submit
        </button>
        <button
          type="button"
          onClick={refetch}
        >
          Refetch
        </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  )
}

```

The problem is, because of the sorting, we might have multiple list entries in the cache. In this scenario, which one do we update?

```ts
['todos', 'list', { sort: 'id' }]
['todos', 'list', { sort: 'title' }]
['todos', 'list', { sort: 'done' }]
```

Well, we'd probably want to update all of them. The problem is, even with just three sort options, this gets gross pretty quick.

```ts
function useAddTodo() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient()

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: addTodo,
    onSuccess: (newTodo) => {
      queryClient.setQueryData(
        ['todos', 'list', { sort: 'id' }],
        (previousTodos) => [...previousTodos, newTodo ]
      )

      queryClient.setQueryData(
        ['todos', 'list', { sort: 'title' }],
        (previousTodos) => [...previousTodos, newTodo ].sort((a, b) => {
          if (String(a.title).toLowerCase() < String(b.title).toLowerCase()) {
            return -1
          }

          if (String(a.title).toLowerCase() > String(b.title).toLowerCase()) {
            return 1
          }

          return 0
        })
      )

      queryClient.setQueryData(
        ['todos', 'list', { sort: 'done' }],
        (previousTodos) => [...previousTodos, newTodo ]
          .sort((a, b) => a.done ? 1 : -1)
      )
    }
  })
}

function useTodos(sort) {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient()

  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['todos', 'list', { sort }],
    queryFn: () => fetchTodos(sort),
    placeholderData: () => queryClient.getQueryData(['todos', 'list', { sort }]),
    staleTime: 10 * 1000
  })
}

export default function TodoList() {
  const [sort, setSort] = React.useState('id')
  const { status, data, isPlaceholderData } = useTodos(sort)
  const addTodo = useAddTodo()

  const handleAddTodo = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    const title = new FormData(event.currentTarget).get('add')
    addTodo.mutate(title, {
      onSuccess: () => event.target.reset()
    })
  }

  if (status === 'pending') {
    return <div>...</div>
  }

  if (status === 'error') {
    return <div>Error fetching todos</div>
  }

  return (
    <div style={{ opacity: isPlaceholderData ? 0.8 : 1 }}>
      <label>
        Sort by:
        <select
          value={sort}
          onChange={(event) => {
            setSort(event.target.value)
        }}>
          <option value="id">id</option>
          <option value="title">title</option>
          <option value="done">completed</option>
        </select>
    </label>
      <ul>
        { data.map(todo => (
          <li key={todo.id}>
            {todo.done ? 'âœ… ' : 'ðŸ—’ '}
            {todo.title}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <form
        onSubmit={handleAddTodo}
        style={{ opacity: addTodo.isPending ? 0.8 : 1 }}
      >
        <label>Add:
          <input
            type="text"
            name="add"
            placeholder="new todo"
          />
        </label>
        <button
          type="submit"
          disabled={addTodo.isPending}
        >
          Submit
        </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  )
}
```

What would happen if the way we sorted the list in our onSuccess callback was different than the way it was sorted on the backend where the actual mutation happens?
In this scenario, the user would see the list sorted one way until a refetch occurred, then they'd see the list sorted another.

That's not ideal.

In scenarios like this where you have an arbitrary number of cache entries that all need to be updated, instead of updating them all manually, a better approach is just to __invalidate all of them__.

The reason being, when you invalidate a query, it does two things:

1. It refetches all active queries
2. It marks the remaining queries as stale

If we look at this from first principles, it makes a lot of sense.

When you invalidate a query, if that query has an observer (meaning it's active and most likely its data is being show to the UI), React Query will instantly refetch it and update the cache. Otherwise, it'll get marked as _stale_ and React Query will refetch it the next time a trigger occurs.

Thankfully React Query makes this pretty simple and the best part is you don't have to worry about the specifics of how the cache is structured. __All you have to do is invoke queryClient.invalidateQueries, passing it a queryKey__.

```ts
function useAddTodo() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient()

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: addTodo,
    onSuccess: () => {
      return queryClient.invalidateQueries({
        queryKey: ['todos', 'list']
      })
    }
  })
}

function useTodos(sort) {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient()

  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['todos', 'list', { sort }],
    queryFn: () => fetchTodos(sort),
    placeholderData: () => queryClient.getQueryData(['todos', 'list', { sort }]),
    staleTime: 10 * 1000
  })
}

export default function TodoList() {
  const [sort, setSort] = React.useState('id')
  const { status, data, isPlaceholderData } = useTodos(sort)
  const addTodo = useAddTodo()

  const handleAddTodo = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    const title = new FormData(event.currentTarget).get('add')
    addTodo.mutate(title, {
      onSuccess: () => event.target.reset()
    })
  }

  if (status === 'pending') {
    return <div>...</div>
  }

  if (status === 'error') {
    return <div>Error fetching todos</div>
  }

  return (
    <div style={{ opacity: isPlaceholderData ? 0.8 : 1 }}>
      <label>
        Sort by:
        <select
          value={sort}
          onChange={(event) => {
            setSort(event.target.value)
        }}>
          <option value="id">id</option>
          <option value="title">title</option>
          <option value="done">completed</option>
        </select>
    </label>
      <ul>
        { data.map(todo => (
          <li key={todo.id}>
            {todo.done ? 'âœ… ' : 'ðŸ—’ '}
            {todo.title}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <form
        onSubmit={handleAddTodo}
        style={{ opacity: addTodo.isPending ? 0.8 : 1 }}
      >
        <label>Add:
          <input
            type="text"
            name="add"
            placeholder="new todo"
          />
        </label>
        <button
          type="submit"
          disabled={addTodo.isPending}
        >
          Submit
        </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now, by returning a promise from onSuccess (which is what queryClient.invalidateQueries returns), React Query can wait for the promise to resolve before it considers the mutation complete â€“ avoiding potential UI flashes where the refetch occurs before the mutation has finished.

Again, __the trick is that invalidation performs a refetch for active queries__. So _instead of taking the response that comes back from the mutation and writing it to the cache manually, we completely ignore it and get the source of truth for the list from the server_.

This has a few obvious advantages â€“ we no longer have to re-implement server logic on the client, and our list will be guaranteed to be up to date.
Of course, it has the drawback of having to make another round-trip to the server, but this is in-line with React Query being a data synchronization tool. After server state has changed, it's usually a good idea to verify you have the latest data in the cache.

Another tradeoff is that the non active queries won't get re-fetched immediately (since they're just marked as stale). Usually this is what you want, but __if you weren't worried about over-fetching__, _you could add a refetchType property of all to your query options to force all queries, regardless of their status, to refetch immediately_.

```ts
queryClient.invalidateQueries({
  queryKey: ['todos', 'list'],
  refetchType: 'all'
})
```

## Fuzzy Query Key matching

When we invoked invalidateQueries, we passed it a query key of ['todos', 'list']. This tells React Query to invalidate all queries that __start with__ ['todos', 'list']. That's why all three of our sort queries were invalidated even though none of them matched ['todos', 'list'] exactly.

```ts
['todos', 'list', { sort: 'id' }]
['todos', 'list', { sort: 'title' }]
['todos', 'list', { sort: 'done' }]
```

Notice that this worked because we structured our queryKey hierarchically. In fact, queryKeys are arrays in the first place because arrays have strict hierarchy built in.
Practically speaking, what this means is that you want to __order your query keys from generic to specific.__
Again if we look at our example, todos is the most generic thing - it refers to our "entity". Then, we have a hardcoded string list, which we've added to distinguish between different kinds of "todo" caches. Finally at the end, we can see the specific "sort".

Now let's say we extended our example by adding a detail view to the UI. If we did that, we'd probably end up with a cache that looked like this.

```ts
['todos', 'list', { sort: 'id' }]
['todos', 'list', { sort: 'title' }]
['todos', 'detail', '1']
['todos', 'detail', '2']
```

And then, if we added another totally unrelated new feature, like our a Post view from the previous lesson, we might even have a cache that looked like this.

```ts
['todos', 'list', { sort: 'id' }]
['todos', 'list', { sort: 'title' }]
['todos', 'detail', '1']
['todos', 'detail', '2']
['posts', 'list', { sort: 'date' }]
['posts', 'detail', '23']
```

Now let's walk through how fuzzy wuzzy matching would work if we invalidated ['todos', 'list'].

```ts
queryClient.invalidateQueries({
  queryKey: ['todos', 'list']
})
```

First, React Query would look at the passed queryKey, take the first element of the array (todos), and filter everything down that matches that string.

```ts
['todos', 'list', { sort: 'id' }]
['todos', 'list', { sort: 'title' }]
['todos', 'detail', '1']
['todos', 'detail', '2']
- ['posts', 'list', { sort: 'date' }]
- ['posts', 'detail', '23']
```

Next, the remaining matches are compared against the second value of the key, list.

```ts
['todos', 'list', { sort: 'id' }]
['todos', 'list', { sort: 'title' }]
- ['todos', 'detail', '1']
- ['todos', 'detail', '2']
- ['posts', 'list', { sort: 'date' }]
- ['posts', 'detail', '23']
```

So what remains, all "todo lists", will be invalidated.

And it's not just the queryKey that you can filter against. For example, you could tell React Query to only match __stale__ queries like this:

```ts
queryClient.invalidateQueries({
  queryKey: ['todos', 'list'],
  stale: true
})
```

or queries that are actively used (ones that have observers), like this.

```ts
queryClient.invalidateQueries({
  queryKey: ['todos', 'list'],
  type: 'active'
})
```

And if you want complete control, __you can even pass a predicate function to invalidateQueries which will be passed the whole query that you can use to filter against__. If the function returns true, it'll match and be invalidated. If it returns false, it'll be excluded.

This is incredibly powerful, especially for cases where your queryKey structure doesn't allow you to target everything with one statement.

For example, you could target all detail queries, no matter their entity, like this.

```ts
queryClient.invalidateQueries({
  predicate: (query) => query.queryKey[1] === 'detail'
})
```

Regardless, the key takeaway is that if you structure your queryKeys appropriately, relying on fuzzy matching, you can invalidate a whole subset of queries with a single call to invalidateQueries.
