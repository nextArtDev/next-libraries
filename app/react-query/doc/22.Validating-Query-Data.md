# Validating Query Data

In fact, you could argue that the most common cause of bugs in web apps is due to the misalignment in the shape of the data that a developer expects, and the actual shape of the data that they receive.
zod is a schema validation library that lets you define the expected shape of a response and then validates the actual response against that schema.
In a way, it acts as a gate where data that doesn't match the schema cannot make its way through. This makes it a perfect solution to integrate with React Query and specifically, any queryFn.
