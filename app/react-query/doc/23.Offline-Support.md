# Offline Support

Though React Query isn't a data fetching library, it does ease a lot of the common pain points around fetching data – including offline support.

In the scenario of an offline device, __React Query will mark the fetchStatus of the query as paused__, without even attempting to execute the queryFn. Then, _if and when the device comes back online, React Query will automatically resume the query as normal_.

Note: To more easily simulate being offline, you can toggle the Wifi icon inside of the React Query devtools.
And if you were to log the query after going offline, you'd see this.

## fetchStatus

The fetchStatus gives us information about the queryFn.
Because _the status is pending, we know that there's no data in the cache_. And because __the fetchStatus is paused, we also know that the device is offline__ and React Query didn't attempt to execute the queryFn.
Remember, isLoading is derived from the status and fetchStatus properties.

```JSON
{
  "status": "pending",
  "data": undefined,
  "fetchStatus": "paused"
}
```

In the scenario where a device goes offline, fetchStatus will be paused and therefore, isLoading will be false even though we don't have any data.

```ts
const isLoading = status === 'pending' && fetchStatus === 'fetching'
```

## networkMode 

Going offline does not clear the cache, This means that if a device goes offline after data has already been fetched and added to the cache, the user will still be able to see the data that was fetched before they went offline. Then, if the device regains connectivity, React Query will automatically attempt to re-fetch the data and update the cache.
__The default value of networkMode is online__, which as you've seen, _tells React Query to "pause" the query and not attempt to execute the queryFn_.

This is a reasonable default, but it doesn't work in every scenario.

For example, what if we had a query that doesn't need a network connection to work? Take this simple one from one of the very first lessons in the course:
There's no reason to pause a query like this just because the device is offline.
In these scenarios, you can set the networkMode to always which will tell React Query to always execute the queryFn, regardless of the network status.
When you do, refetchOnReconnect will automatically be set to false since regaining the network connection is no longer a good indicator that stale queries should be re-fetched.

```ts
const { data } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['luckyNumber'],
  queryFn: () => Promise.resolve(7),
})
```

Another option is to __set networkMode to offlineFirst__. In this mode, _the first request is always fired, and then potential retries are paused if the initial request failed because of a missing network connection_.
When would this mode be a good choice? __Every time you have an additional caching layer in between your API and React Query__. A good example of this is the browser cache itself.
This header will instruct the browser to cache the response for 60 seconds, which means that every subsequent request within that time period that React Query makes will not actually hit the GitHub API, but will instead be served from the browser's cache.
 
```ts
cache-control: public, max-age=60, s-maxage=60
```

Reading from the browser cache is not only extremely fast, it also works while we are offline! However, with React Query's default networkMode of online, because all requests are paused when the device is offline, we can't take advantage of it.
With offlineFirst, if a request has been made and stored in the browser's cache before the device goes offline, React Query will still invoke the queryFn, which will call fetch, getting data from the browser's cache and returning it to React Query. If there's no data in the browser's cache, React Query will pause the query and wait until the device regains connectivity to try again.

## Mutations

Now dealing with offline support when it comes to fetching data isn't terribly difficult, and React Query's default behavior is usually good enough most of the time. However, things get a little more complicated when we start talking about mutations.

Because mutations have side effects on the server, unlike queries, we have to be a little more deliberate with how we handle them when the device reconnects.
Thankfully, React Query's default strategy for this scenario does a lot of the heavy lifting for us.
When mutations occur when a device is offline, React Query will keep track of them in a queue. Then, once the device goes back online, it will unload the queue of mutations in the exact same order that they occurred, in parallel.
The reason this works so well is because onMutate, which writes to the cache, is called before the mutation gets paused. Once we go online again, we can see that each checkbox changes states one by one - in the order in which they ocurred.
Right now, once finished, every mutation calls queryClient.invalidateQueries. This was fine before, but now we have a scenario where multiple mutations will all affect the same entity. The result, as we can clearly see, is an eventually consistent UI – but those in-between invalidations show us an intermediate server state that causes the UI to jump a bit.
Instead, it would be ideal if when the app reconnected, it only invalidated the query once, at the very end of the mutation chain.

To do this, we need to get a little clever.

First, inside of onSettled (which will run when all the other callbacks have finished running), let's only invalidate the query if there are no other mutations going on at the moment. This way we can get rid of those in-between invalidations that cause the UI to jump.

To do this, we can use queryClient's isMutating API. The way it works is it returns an integer representing how many mutations, if any, are currently happening.

Of course, we only want to invalidate our query if there is 1 mutation happening – our own.
