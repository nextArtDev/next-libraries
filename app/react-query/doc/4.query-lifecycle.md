# The Query Lifecycle

One of the best aspects of React Query is that _it makes writing asynchronous logic feel as if it were synchronous_.

We're trying to access map on data, but until the async request has resolved, data is going to be undefined.

Of course, we could always use a conditional to check if data is undefined before accessing map, but React Query comes with an even better option â€“ exposing its internal _Query States_ to let you know which status the query is currently in:

- _pending_ - the Query has not yet completed, so you don't have data yet.
- _success_ - the Query has finished successfully, and data is available.
- _error_ - the Query has failed, and you have an error.
Those statuses directly correspond to the state a Promise can be in - pending, fulfilled or rejected, which hopefully makes sense as React Query is entirely Promise based.

You have two options for accessing the status of the query.

The first, naturally, is via the status property that useQuery returns.

```typescript
function MediaDevices() {
  const { data, status } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['mediaDevices'],
    queryFn: () => {
      return navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()
    }
  })

  if (status === 'pending') {
    return <div>...</div>
  }

  if (status === 'error') {
    return <div>We were unable to access your media devices</div>
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((device) => (
        <li key={device.deviceId}>{device.label}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

The second, if you prefer a little flavor, is via the derived boolean flags, _isPending_, _isSuccess_ and _isError_ that are __also available on the object returned by useQuery__.

```typescript
function MediaDevices() {
  const { data, isPending, isError } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['mediaDevices'],
    queryFn: () => {
      return navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()
    }
  })

  if (isPending === true) {
    return <div>...</div>
  }

  if (isError === true) {
    return <div>We were unable to access your media devices</div>
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((device) => (
        <li key={device.deviceId}>{device.label}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
